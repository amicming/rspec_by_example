# Student Details

- In [First Hello RSpec!!! example] (https://github.com/amicming/rspec_by_example/tree/master/Hello_RSpec) and [Palindrome example] (https://github.com/amicming/rspec_by_example/tree/master/palindrome) we used class level methods, now in this repo we'll going to work with instances, objects of classes and instaces methods.

- In Student class, we will add student's first, last and full name
- Any student object should thus respond to first, last and full name
